# DO NOT READ THIS IF YOU HAVE NOT DONE THE PROBLEMS YOURSELF. SPOILER ALERT

I'm posting my answers to the [LearnYouNode](http://nodeschool.io/#learn-you-node) problems so people can see what I wrote and call me stupid for doing so.

I found most of the problems to be pretty easy except for the exercise with 3 http requests at once. Good times!
